# Random Password Generator

## Description

I have created a random password generator with options of using at least one of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The length of this password must be between 8-128 characters long. This is useful for users who need a strong password for files/accounts. 

## Usage

To use: <br>
1. Follow the link below. <br>
2. Click the "Generate Password" button. <br>
3. List a password length between 8-128 characters. <br>
4. Click the "OK" button for "yes" or "Cancel" button for "no" for the following questions on what is to be included in your password. <br>
5. A random password with your desired length and criteria will be displayed.
